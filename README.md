# final-project

**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**  
I look at what the user wants, then write simple tasks called user stories. This helps me stay focused and build the right features for the user.

**How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**  
I like to build programs step by step. I plan to use sprints, user stories, and regular reviews to stay organized and improve my work.

**What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**  
A good team member listens, asks questions, shares ideas, and supports the team. Communication and teamwork help everyone succeed.
